This is the GUI based version of the examples found in the Examples folder of the ASCII-ART repo

This implementation make use of a package called TKinter which is part of the standard python distributions after version 3.1

The working is simple, the following script will launch an application with the help of the QT (pronounced "cute") framework which is a free and open-source widget took kit for Creating GUIs that are cross platform. You may choose any image file in your local system by selecting the 'choose' button in the application. Once you have selected an image, the ASCII art of the image will be displayed within the application. The Art is displayed as text and hence can be edited.

The version used for development is python 3.8.5

To run from the Client use the following command - python make_art_GUI_QT.py.

(or) 

Direcly run from from your preferred IDE's.

Have fun by changing the UI and feel free to even add modifications. Cheers!
